RANDOM DYLAN NOTES

xray flashes - the presence of xray flashes is analagous but not the 
	same as black hole formation
	could be nothing as data is all random? means there may be no 
	physics link

b-v can be taken as b-g (should/might be same wavelengths) 
or even b-r

fit this to blackbody curves (blackbody in assumed in this universe)

check out 'curvefit'/'curve_fit'? in numpy or scipy, might have to use 
anonymous functions

poisson statistics versus gaussian staistics

fast radio bursts?

for luminosity
integration of blackbody curves gives flux at our position?
	to find flux
	determine bb curve for star
	normalise to given fluxes
	numerically integrate over 'all' fluxes to find total flux
then find lumin using flux distance equation


y_inte * factor = blueF
factor = blueF / y_inte

DYLAN CODE OUTPUT

stars - data frame with distances and uncertainties for every variable star, using period-luminosity relationship


RYAN CODE OUTPUT

same thing for every star in a good galaxy

galaxies - dataframe with positions, distances, uncertainties of each galaxy using H-R diagram fitting


PARALLAX MASTER STAR CODE OUTPUT
same thing 




ryan
create galaxy class which has galaxy.stars, galaxy.distance, galaxy.meanRV, and uncertainties
sinead can use this for rot curves

then calibrate the x-ray flashes using mine and dylans data
then calibrate the fuzzies

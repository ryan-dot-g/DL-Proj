dyls
complete period-luminosity relationship
use it to get distances to every variable star
talk about stellar populations - temps or size, look at 2nd year stuff
bolometric luminosity?
fit black body to spectra to get temp and radius

ryan
then calibrate the x-ray flashes using mine and dylans data
then calibrate the fuzzies to get hubbles constant
talk about if the universe is isotropic
talk about galaxy clusters and presence of intercluster dark matter?

sinead
rotation curves using ryan galaxy clustering
need to remove outlier stars, or just remove the entire galaxy
need to think about how to correct for inclination to get true radius and true radial velocities - u know spiral galaxies are roughly circular so can find major/minor axes
or if its too hard, just dont do it
fit the envelope, bunch of data underneath outer curve. Think about why
mass distribution in galaxies - dark matter?
galaxy classification
